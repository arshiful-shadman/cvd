# Predicting-Cardiovascular-Disease
A coursework project to predict cardiovascular disease from behavioral risk factors, using different machine learning models. The project was implemented using R markdown. For ease of viewing, the R markdown file has been knitted into an HTML file. 

| File    | Description    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Predicting Cardiovascular Disease.Rmd   |R markdown file containing code for analysis and descriptions written in markdown format.|
|Predicting Cardiovascular Disease.html|Knitted R Markdown file. This is an essentially an HTML file created from the Markdown file. It contains all relevant code snippets as well as output models and tables. Open this to view results and code for the analysis easily.|
|cardio.csv| Dataset with 70,000 rows containing behavioral risk factors such as 'smoker or non smoker', 'blood pressure', etc. Obtained from Kaggle. Most variables are coded as '0' or '1' with '0' with '0' indicating absence of risk factor or cardiovascular disease and '1' indicating presence of risk factor or cardiovascular disease.|

## Instructions to replicate:
1. Download data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) or clone this repository.
2. Make sure downloaded data or 'cardio.csv' from the cloned repository is in the same directory as Predicting Cardiovascular Disease.Rmd
3. Open Predicting Cardiovascular Disease.Rmd to see code OR select 'Knit' to see entire analysis in markdown format.
